# Hooli-style Popup

[kaizengami](https://github.com/kaizengami) did 
[a great job](https://github.com/kaizengami/Google-style-Popup)
implementing a Kottans frontend course
[task on HTML/CSS popup](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/html-css-popup.md).

The course needs different mock-ups (not mimicking Google)
to protect Kottans students from possible ban of their
GitHub pages sub-domains as Google may decide these
are the phishing pages.

So I took the kaziengami's project and changed it
to make different mocks for the task.  

[Demo](https://oleksiyrudenko.github.io/hooli-style-popup/) 

1. `npm install` to install dependencies 
1. `npm run dev` to run the app in development mode  
1. `npm run build` to build the app for production  
1. `npm run publish` to publish built app on GitHub pages
